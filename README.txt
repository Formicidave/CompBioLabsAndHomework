This repository serves multiple functions.

First, it allows a standardized submission of assignments for EBIO5420.
Second, it allows me to become familiar with the basic uses of GitHub by adding to and maintaining a repository.

Directories contained in this repository usually represent weekly lab assignments demonstrating basic coding in R. Additional files either utilized by or generated by the R scripts may also be present.
